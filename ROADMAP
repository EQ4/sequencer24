Sequencer24/Seq24 Roadmap
Chris Ahlstrom
2015-07-23 to 2015-07-23

The starting point for the Sequencer24 project is version
0.9.2 of seq24.  The following changes are planned:

   -  Create a Git project out of the existing Seq24 files: sequencer24
   -  Branch off to a permanent "Legacy" branch:
      -  Add this ROADMAP file to the legacy branch.
      -  Make any changes needed to get the code to build and running in the
         old way.  Hopefully, no changes will be needed.
      -  Tag the legacy branch and record the tag in the parent ROADMAP.
   -  Branch off to a "Debian" branch:
      -  Add the Debian files obtained from Debian.org, and verify that
         a Debian package could be made.
      -  Merge "Debian" back into the main trunk.
   -  Branch off to a "Catchup" branch:
      -  Add the LASH fixes found on GitHub, and verify functionality.
      -  Other easy fixes found anywhere?
      -  Merge "Catchup" back into the main trunk.
   -  Branch off to a "Packaging" branch:
      -  Add a bootstrap script.
      -  Add a pack script.
      -  Fix and verify any Debian packaging issues.
      -  Merge "Packaging" back into the main trunk.
   -  Branch off to a "Gtkmm-3" branch.
      -  Update the GUI, document the changes, and verify functionality.
      -  Merge "Gtkmm-3" back into the main trunk.
   -  Branch off to a "Document" branch:
      -  Document each module.
      -  Get an idea of the design, and document it.
      -  Generate Doxygen documentation.
      -  Merge "Document" back into the main trunk.
   -  Branch off to a "Library" branch:
      -  Break out functionality into libsequencer24.
      -  Unit test each element as appropriate using xpc-suite
         functionality.
      -  Enhance documentation and recreate it.
      -  Rebuild application using library code.
      -  Verify functionality.
      -  Merge "Library" back into the main trunk.
   -  Create a separate "sequencer24-doc" project and update the
      documentation to reflect the name changes and new project.
   -  Branch off to an "Enhancements" branch:
      -  TO BE DETERMINED.
