M4 Notes
Chris Ahlstrom
2015-07-24 to 2015-07-24

Bootstrapping the project on a Gentoo system led to the following notes, and
we're keeping the new versions.

aclocal-1.11:

   overwriting 4/libtool.m4' with usr/share/aclocal/libtool.m4'
   overwriting 4/ltoptions.m4' with usr/share/aclocal/ltoptions.m4'
   overwriting 4/ltversion.m4' with usr/share/aclocal/ltversion.m4'
   overwriting 4/lt~obsolete.m4' with usr/share/aclocal/lt~obsolete

   Also of later version was: ax_prefix_config_h.m4
