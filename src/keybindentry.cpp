 *  This module define a GTK text-edit widget for getting keyboard button
 *  values (for binding keys).  Put the cursor in the text-box, hit a key,
 *  and something like  'a' (42)  appears...  each keypress replaces the
 *  previous text.  It also supports key-event and key-group maps in the
 *  perform class.
