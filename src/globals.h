/**
 * \file          globals.h
 *
 *  This module declares/defines just some of the global (gasp!) variables
 *  in this application.
 *
 * \library       sequencer24 application
 * \author        Seq24 team; modifications by Chris Ahlstrom
 * \date          2015-07-25

 *
 *  We're going to try to collect all the globals here in one module, and
 *  try to group them into functional units.
 *
 *  This collection of global variables describes some facets of the
 *  "Patterns Panel" or "Sequences Window", which is visually presented by
 *  the Gtk::Window-derived class called mainwnd.
 *
 *  The Patterns Panel contains an 8-by-4 grid of "pattern boxes" or
 *  "sequence boxes".  All of the patterns in this grid comprise what is
 *  called a "set" (in the musical sense) or a "screen set".
 *
 *  Other elements are also set by some of these variables.  See the
 *  spreadsheet in <tt>contrib/sequence24-classes.ods</tt>.
 *
 * \note
 *    This set of variables would be better off placed in a object that the
 *    mainwnd class and its clients can access a little more safely and with
 *    a lot more clarity for the human reader.
