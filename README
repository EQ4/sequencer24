README for Sequencer24 0.9.3

2015-07-24 to 2015-08-29

The sequencer24 project is a gradual refactoring of seq24 0.9.2
to bring it up to date, fix bugs, consolidate patches, convert
to GTKmm 3, and much more.

For the latest code, check out the "Fixes" branch.  The master branch
is a few weeks old now.

It is done as a series of Git branches (x means it is done, y means in
progress):

x  Legacy:     The original Seq24 0.9.2 with some notes.
x  Debian:     Incorporating Debians packaging support into the project.
x  Catchup:    Incorporating a few patches found around the Internet.
x  Packaging:  Getting the build system up-to-date; bootstrapping; packing.
x  Gtkmm-3:    Porting from gtkmm-2.4 to gtkmm-3.0.  Turned out to be trivial.
x  Document:   Adding thorough in-code documentation and upgraded formatting.
x  Fixes:      More documentation, fixes, and some new features.  Moving
               some fixes to the upcoming Library branch.
   Library:    Refactor the code to separate and unit-test functionality.

The Fixes branch is in progress.  Light documentation, code prettifying,
warning elimination, valgrind clean.  Trying to get a handle on all the
global variables and how things work.

See the ROADMAP file for more information and a kind of TODO list.

Note that the original seq24 is pretty well documented by the following
project, which provides a 50-page PDF file and its LaTeX source code:

However, we have found some documentation mistakes while researching, and
will have to correct those mistakes soon.
