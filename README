2015-07-24 to 2015-07-24

The sequencer24 project is a gradual refactoring of seq24 0.9.2
to bring it up to date, fix bugs, consolidate patches, convert
to GTKmm 3, and more.

It is done as a series of Git branches:

   Legacy:     The original Seq24 0.9.2 with some notes.
   Debian:     Incorporated Debian's packaging support.
   Catchup:    Incorporating a few patches found around the Internet.
   Packaging:  Getting the build system up-to-date; bootstrapping; packing.
   Gtkmm-3:    Porting from gtkmm-2.4 to gtkmm-3.0.
   Document:   Adding thorough in-code documentation and upgraded formatting.
   Library:    Refactor the code to separate and unit-test functionality.

Eventually, there will be a few features to add.
