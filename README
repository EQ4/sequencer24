README for Sequencer24 0.9.3

2015-07-24 to 2015-08-03

The sequencer24 project is a gradual refactoring of seq24 0.9.2
to bring it up to date, fix bugs, consolidate patches, convert
to GTKmm 3, and more.

It is done as a series of Git branches (x means it is done):

x  Legacy:     The original Seq24 0.9.2 with some notes.
x  Debian:     Incorporating Debian's packaging support into the project.
x  Catchup:    Incorporating a few patches found around the Internet.
x  Packaging:  Getting the build system up-to-date; bootstrapping; packing.
x  Gtkmm-3:    Porting from gtkmm-2.4 to gtkmm-3.0.  Turned out to be trivial.
   Document:   Adding thorough in-code documentation and upgraded formatting.
   Library:    Refactor the code to separate and unit-test functionality.

The Document branch, first pass, is in progress.  Light documentation, code
prettifying, warning elimination.  Trying to get a handle on all the global
variables and how things work.

See the ROADMAP file for more information and a kind of TODO list.

Note that the original seq24 is pretty well documented by the following
project, which provides a 50-page PDF file and its LaTeX source code:
