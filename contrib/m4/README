Conversion to GTKmm-3.0

We want to try to tag deprecated functions in gtkmm-2.0 that were used
by Seq24.  So....

dk-warn.m4:

   We got this file (and some others) by grabbing the master ZIP of this
   project, unpacking, and copying the m4 files:

      https://github.com/GNOME/regexxer

   This file actually part of Daniel Elstner's "Autostuff" project.

mm-warnings.m4:

   However, it is easier to install the mm-common package, which installs
   similar macros in /usr/share/aclocal/:

      mm-ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx_11.m4
      mm-common.m4
      mm-dietlib.m4
      mm-doc.m4
      mm-module.m4
      mm-pkg.m4

   The macro we want, MM_ARG_ENABLE_WARNINGS, is in mm-warnings.m4.
   Apparently Daniel Elstner wrote that, too.

However, enabling the warning got deep into gtk++ header files for
deprecated stuff.

We had better luck just going straight to gtkmm-3.0 right away.
