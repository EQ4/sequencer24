Sigc22-fix Updates from GitHub

2015-07-23 to 2015-07-24

Downloaded the master ZIP file from https://github.com/pld-linux/seq24
and put the contents here for safe-keeping while incorporating them.

It turns out that all of the fixes in this patch were already incorporated
into seq24 v0.9.2; they almost exclusively involved changing the "SigC"
namespace to "sigc".
