This directory contains contributed code, patches, and ideas for
future work and testing found on the Internet and elsewhere.

Patch directories:

   freddix
   OMA
   pld-linux

Bootstrap files:

   config.rpath
   mkinstalldirs-1.10

Other files:

   astylerc        Copy to ~/.astylerc to use astyle to format the code.
   cscope.files    For use by cscope.
   oxref.txt       Generated by oxref object file cross-referencer.
   fix.sed         Reworks the file banners for prettiness.
   HOME.gitignore  My current ~/.gitignore file.
   pad             Used for turning off the touchpad that was killing me.

   b4uacuse-seq24.midi
                    A non-GM-compliant file (for Yamaha PSS-790 synth)
                    imported into Sequencer24.

                    The same file, saved in the new Sequencer24 format.

Ideas:

   Several years ago (in summer 2008, actually), I made several (crappy)
   patches for seq24 which lead to "features" that I needed:
   - play/stop/play from beginning can be bind to any MIDI control
     (PC, CC, note, and so on),
   - change of the number of lines/columns (I wanted to extend this so that
     it could be saved in file, so that it would just have been part of it
     and not something depending on seq24),
   - menus for number of bars and numerators of bars were writable, so that
     you can set anything you want (especially useful when dealing with
     asymetric bars),

# vim: sw=4 ts=4 wm=8 et ft=sh
