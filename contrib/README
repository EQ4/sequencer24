   Several years ago (in summer 2008, actually), I made several (crappy)
   patches for seq24 which lead to "features" that I needed:
   - play/stop/play from beginning can be bind to any MIDI control
     (PC, CC, note, and so on),
   - change of the number of lines/columns (I wanted to extend this so that
     it could be saved in file, so that it would just have been part of it
     and not something depending on seq24),
   - menus for number of bars and numerators of bars were writable, so that
     you can set anything you want (especially useful when dealing with
     asymetric bars),
