Analyzing the Parsing of b4uacuse-seq24.midi
2015-08-15 to 2015-08-15

We found a bug (self-induced) in the reading of this file. While tracking it
down, we also examined how a naming track is treated, and how the
proprietary section of the Seq24 MIDI file is processed.

Reading Clapton name track:

   -  status (m_data[0x13aa3]) = FF, type= 7F (proprietary), length = 4
      Delta = 0 timestamp = 0

      In midifile.cpp #280, we read a long only if len > 4, but nothing
      otherwise -- we skip len bytes in the buffer.  This skips:

         SeqSpec 24 24 00 08

      This is c_triggers, but there are no triggers in this case.

   -  status = FF, type= 7F (proprietary), length = 5
      Now len > 4, so we read a long [and do len -= 4], and get 0x24240001 ==
      c_midibus, so we read the next byte [and do len--] to get the MIDI buss = 0.

   -  status = FF, type= 7F (proprietary), length = 6
      proprietary = 0x24240006 == c_timesig, and we get the two byte 04 04 to
      set beats-per-measure = 4 and beat-width = 4

   -  status = FF, type= 7F (proprietary), length = 5, proprietary = 0x24240002
      == c_midich, and that byte is 0.

   -  status = FF, type= 2F (track end), length = 0
      Delta = 48, the sequence length ends up being 48 (but no notes or other
      MIDI events)

      This sequence gets added to the perform object.  This particular
      sequence has only a track name and some parametric information,
      so we would like to be able to have it not be played...
      
      ...Visible, but not active.

   To summarize:

      MTrk
      0 SeqNr 12
      0 Meta TrkName "Eric Clapton &"
      0 SeqSpec 24 24 00 08            # c_triggers, no triggers
      0 SeqSpec 24 24 00 01 00         # c_midibus, buss 0
      0 SeqSpec 24 24 00 06 04 04
      0 SeqSpec 24 24 00 02 00
      48 Meta TrkEnd
      TrkEnd

Seq24 Data at the end:

   After all the tracks are read, Seq24 checks for extra data.
   If there is extra data, Seq24 reads a long value.  The first one
   encountered is 

      0x24240010 == Seq24's c_midictrl proprietary value.

   ===== BUG =====

   Getting this value first is actually wrong, it is bad MIDI.
   As we saw above, we first need the triad of

   -  status = FF, type= 7F (proprietary), length = whatever

   So, as a bug fix, we need to be able to write this information properly,
   and read it.  We also need to be able to read the wrong format as well,
   to support legacy Seq24 MIDI files.

   ===============

   Any way, we have c_midictrl.  Next, we read a long value, seqs.  It is 0.

-  24 24 00 10 00 00 00 00

   Read the next long value, 0x24240003.  This is c_midiclocks.  We get a
   value of 0 for "TrackLength":

-  24 24 00 03 00 00 00 00

   If TrackLength were > 0, then for each value, we would read a byte value
   represent the bus a clock was on, and setting the clock value of the
   master MIDI buss.

   Another check for more data is made.

-  24 24 00 05 00 20 00 00

   0x24240005 is c_notes.  The value screen_sets is read (two bytes) and
   here is 0x20 = 32.  For each screen-set:

      len = read_short()

   If non-zero, each of the len bytes is appended as a string.  Here, len is 
   0 for all 32 screenset, so the screen-set notepad is set to an empty
   string.

   Another check for more data is made.

-  24 24 00 07 00 00 00 78

   0x24240007 is c_bpmtag.  The long value is read and sets the perform
   object's bpm value.  Here, it is 120 bpm.

   Another check for more data is made.

-  24 24 00 09 00 00 04 00

   0x24240009 is c_mutegroups.  The long value obtained here is 1024.
   If this value is not equal to the constant c_gmute_tracks (1024), a
   warning is emitted to the console, but processing continues anyway,
   32 x 32 long values are read to select the given group-mute, and then set
   each of its 32 group-mute-states.

   In our sample file, 32 groups are specified, but all 32 group-mute-state
   values for each are 0.
