Random Ideas for Documentation and Improvements

Found on the web, suggested enhancements for seq24:

   https://blueprints.launchpad.net/seq24/+spec/advanced-song-editor-features

   1. Nested patterns. The ability to select a set of blocks and save the set
      as a single block would enable complex patterns to be more easily
      managed.

   2. Block transpose. A facility to transpose a whole block or set of blocks.

   3. Zoom. Ability to zoom-in to facilitate easier positioning of blocks for
      more complex rhythms.

   4. Playback control. Ability to move the playback position to any point
      while playing.

   5. Loop control. Ability to specify multiple loops, each with their own
      marker pairs. Also, loop counters.  Possibly also a scripting language
      to control looping and other flow of control. Loop count of 1 would
      allow for a non-looped section.

      Click in patterns panel to arm the pattern and cause it to play.  That
      turns the pattern box white-on-black.  So I had it backwards; black
      means the sequence is unmuted!

      Right ctrl modifier key (Ctrl - q!!!)  Queue key.  Add to the "mute"
      key (wrong word) to set up the pattern to "kick in".

      Change R-Ctrl to a Windows key.

      Snapshotting, easier than queuing.
      
      Selecting specific notes to be affected by the "data" editor.

      Flow of data events...

Tricks for Zyn/Yosh:

    In zynaddsubfx, you get more precise control if you turn the
    knobs/controls with your right mouse button. 

Internal:

   locks, mutex members:

      mastermidibus and its _portmidi sibling
      midibus and its _portmidi sibling
      sequence
      mutex (and condition_var class)
      perform (condition variable object)

      RUN helgrind on Sequencer24 !!!

# vim: sw=4 ts=4 wm=8 et ft=sh
