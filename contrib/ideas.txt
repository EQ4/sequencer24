Random Ideas for Documentation and Improvements
2015-08-25 to 2015-08-29

Found on the web, suggested enhancements for seq24:

   https://blueprints.launchpad.net/seq24/+spec/advanced-song-editor-features

   1. Nested patterns. The ability to select a set of blocks and save the set
      as a single block would enable complex patterns to be more easily
      managed.

   2. Block transpose. A facility to transpose a whole block or set of blocks.

   3. Zoom. Ability to zoom-in to facilitate easier positioning of blocks for
      more complex rhythms.

   4. Playback control. Ability to move the playback position to any point
      while playing.

   5. Loop control. Ability to specify multiple loops, each with their own
      marker pairs. Also, loop counters.  Possibly also a scripting language
      to control looping and other flow of control. Loop count of 1 would
      allow for a non-looped section.

More:

   -  Ability to change time signature, either within a pattern, or for
      different patterns, or maybe in the Song Editor.

      Click in patterns panel to arm the pattern and cause it to play.  That
      turns the pattern box white-on-black.  So I had it backwards; black
      means the sequence is unmuted!

      Change R-Ctrl to a Windows key or some other key.

      Snapshotting, easier than queuing.
      
      Selecting specific notes to be affected by the "data" editor.

      Flow of data events...

      Realtime pattern triggering:

        Immediate triggering, use the hot-key for that pattern.

        Queing one or more patterns to trigger at the next repeat, hold down the
        modifier key as each hot-key is struck.  Default modifier key is
        the Right Ctrl key (Ctrl-q is the Exit key!!!).  [Go to
        Options/Keyboard/Queue (key) and provide an alternate key, such as
        the Super key.  [Will this affect the Super key in the Pattern
        Editor or Song Editor windows????]  To provide an alternate key,
        click in the Queue field and press the desired modifier key.

            Super (L and R)
            Ctrl (L and R)
            Alt (L and R)
            Menu key
            Fxx keys

        Add to the pattern's toggle key (wrong word) to setup the pattern
        to kick in.

        Note the grey center painted in the pattern's box when the pattern
        is queued up.  [Need a SCREEN SHOT!]

        Keep queue [default is Backslash key]:

            This is like a LOCK key for the pattern queing, so that you
            need hit only the pattern's hot key to get it queued up; no
            need for the queing modifier key.  In fact, the queing modifier
            key unlocks the keep queue (it seems).

        Snapshots (another pattern-triggering option):
        
            Set snapshot up for the left Windows key.  This key can be set
            up in Options / Keyboard / Snapshot 1 (or Snapshot 2).

            Press that snapshot key, and trigger/untrigger the patterns you
            want.  When that snapshot key is released, the setup reverts to
            what it was when you pressed that snapshot key.

            Good for taking a number of parts out one at a time, then
            having them all start back up at one time (reverting to the
            "snapshot".

        Pattern editor:

            Drawing velocities.  Affects all notes, or only the selected
            notes.

            Expand the pattern by increasing the number of bars in it.

            Copy and paste, pasting to different vertical position to
            create a transposed copy.

            MIDI CC automation.  Select the CC, then drawing by dragging
            across the event strip, which paints events at the given
            "resolution" you set up with the note-length menu entry.

            Extra notes added on repeats from note editor or from a MIDI
            keyboard.

Tricks for Zyn/Yosh:

    In zynaddsubfx, you get more precise control if you turn the
    knobs/controls with your right mouse button. 

Internal:

   locks, mutex members:

      mastermidibus and its _portmidi sibling
      midibus and its _portmidi sibling
      sequence
      mutex (and condition_var class)
      perform (condition variable object)

      RUN helgrind on Sequencer24 !!!

Replacing std::list<>: Current list usage sequences:

    Reading a file:

        Get event from file;
        m_events.push_front(event);
        m_events.sort()
            event::operator <, first timestamp, then "rank";
        
        merges:

            Merge selected events from clipboard into event list, sort them.
            Sort transposed events, then merge them (no second sorting).
            Sort quantized  events, then merge them (no second sorting).

Playback use cases:

    ALSA:

        Run "yoshimi -a -A &".
        Set [manual-alsa-ports] to 0 in ~/.seq24rc.
