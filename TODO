Sequencer24/Seq24 TODO Updates
Chris Ahlstrom
2015-07-24 to 2015-07-24

These are my best guesses as to what was done in 0.9.2; some more
TODOs may already be done, I will update as I discover them.
Don't forget to check out the new ROADMAP file as well.

<0.9.2>

[sequence editor]

[X] Ctrl Z undo seq + perf
[x] Ctrl + select = adds to selection (roll + event) m_seq->unselect
[X] Window Raise on Edit 
[x] Static clipboard share
[X] Do not use selected for internal stuff
[X] Midi items are not de-selected after actions are taken (copy too)
[x] Paste buffer shouldn't clear
[x] paint notes
[x] paint events

[x] Port Names and number specd in rc file 
[x] Controllers Speced in rc file eg. (Wavestation MIDI 1) (SuperNova Filter)
[ ] Notes Speced in rc file eg. Bass Drum (no black/white)

[ ] sorting of events placed into event list
    0) Program Changes
    1) CC's
    2) Notes
    3) MSB? LSB?
[ ] If Data Entries are placed on same tick, Make Course First ??
[ ] If NRPN or RPN are on same tick, Make Course First ??
    
[ ] Shuffle Quantize (percent and note from tool options)
[x] Keyboard start/stop 
[ ] Midi start/stop
[ ] More scales!
[X] Make the sequence editor grow tool stretch over the length.
[x] Bump default song length way up.
[X] Stretch Notes ( Rubber Band)
[ ] Listen to notes as you draw / move?
[X] Vertical Lines at grid snap ?
[ ] exclusive groups (only one item in row or column can be active)
[x] copy and paste between sequences (make clipboard static)
[ ] Mouse move on piano roll/key roll, change background a bit ( check with scales on)
[ ] Scroll on dragging ?
[ ] Event mute ?
[x] Stretch w/ Ctrl (Federico)
[ ] Change background sequence color

[x] Test Maxim Patches w/ wheel mouse
    Make sure data entry still does its thing w/ wheel

   1) When clicking on an event only one (the "topmost") event is selected.
      useful to decouple two events that are eventually stocked on top one
      another.
   2) If there are any events selected, data editor only changes controller.
      values for these events; if there are no events selected it acts as
      usual.
   3) Data editor slope line can be dragged outside of data editor window;
      controller values are adjusted to fit (0,127).  Makes it easier
      setting all controllers to min/max value.
   4) Mouse wheel scrolls the grid up/down in sequence editor and song editor.
      Maxim Krikun[+].
   5) Scrolling draw.

[X] Quantize Button
